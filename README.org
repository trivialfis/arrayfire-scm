This is an work-in-progress project for binding /arrayfire/ with /guile/ Scheme.

* Introduction
I'm only doing this for fun, some basic blas and statistic operations are planed.

* Current status

I didn't do any safe checking, so calling scheme procedure is not safer than
calling c function directly. Loads of segfault await. :)

** What's working
  + Construct af_array from scheme array.
  + Logical operations.
  + Basic linear algebra functions.

** What's not working
   Anything else.
